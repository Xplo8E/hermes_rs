# UI Design Concept
*This mockup visualizes the premium 3-pane layout described in the plan.*

## Key Elements
1.  **Navigation (Left)**: Designed for handling thousands of functions. Supports search and filtering.
2.  **Code (Center)**: The core experience. Clean, readable, with distinct colors for opcodes vs operands.
3.  **Context (Right)**: The "Intelligence" layer. Shows where you are and what the data state looks like.
